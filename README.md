# Huckel_Theory_Extension

The objective of this project was to apply the MTB/2 method to calculate the total energy and heat of formation values for different classes of hydrocarbons consisting of alkanes, unsaturated aliphatic, cyclic, and aromatic compounds. Enthalpy calculations are reported with respect to diatomic hydrogen while energy values are reported with respect to benzene. All values are reported in kcal/mol. Example compounds were downloaded from Pubchem and are located in the data directory.
